**Zed discord presence** is an extension for [Zed](https://zed.dev) that adds support for [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) using LSP

Using LSP is a workaround for now (yeah, it's a bit hacky) but once Zed has proper extension support, I'll rewrite it.

### Requirements

[rust](https://rust-lang.org) is required for installing this extension. \
The easiest way to get [rust](https://rust-lang.org) is by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
